# nextjs-scss-router-express

Boilerplate for NextJS separating CSS from components (avoids CSS-in-JS) and using Express-style routes. All the benefits of NextJS but separates styles from logic.

SCSS entrypoint is `main.scss`.
Add routes in `routes.js`.
Express entrypoint in `server.js`.

To quickly set up, use Yarn (`npm install -g yarn`), `yarn install`. Then `yarn dev`.

For production: `yarn build`, `yarn start`.
